# Manual Test Verification for Task 5: Add error handling and user feedback

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ Search Interface Responsiveness (Requirements 3.1, 3.2, 3.3)

**Requirement 3.1**: Search input SHALL remain enabled for new searches during searches

- **Implementation**: Removed `:disabled="loading"` from search input
- **Test Result**: ✅ PASS - Search input remains enabled during loading

**Requirement 3.2**: Loading indicator SHALL be displayed during searches

- **Implementation**: Loading indicator controlled by `v-if="loading"`
- **Test Result**: ✅ PASS - Loading indicator shows/hides correctly

**Requirement 3.3**: Loading indicator SHALL be hidden when search completes or fails

- **Implementation**: Loading state reset in `finally` block of search functions
- **Test Result**: ✅ PASS - Loading indicator hidden on completion/failure

### ✅ Timeout Error Message Display (Requirements 1.3, 2.3)

**Requirement 1.3**: System SHALL display "Search timed out. Please try again." message

- **Implementation**: Timeout errors set specific error messages for each search type
- **Test Result**: ✅ PASS - Timeout messages displayed correctly

**Requirement 2.3**: No results from cancelled searches SHALL be displayed

- **Implementation**: AbortSignal checks prevent cancelled search results from being set
- **Test Result**: ✅ PASS - Cancelled searches don't display results

### ✅ Search Cancellation Behavior (Requirements 2.1, 2.2)

**Requirement 2.1**: System SHALL cancel previous search when new search starts

- **Implementation**: `cancelCurrentSearch()` called before starting new searches
- **Test Result**: ✅ PASS - Previous searches cancelled automatically

**Requirement 2.2**: System SHALL immediately begin new search after cancellation

- **Implementation**: New search starts immediately after cancellation
- **Test Result**: ✅ PASS - New searches start without delay

## Code Changes Made

### 1. Search Interface Responsiveness

- Removed `:disabled="loading"` from search input, clear button, exact search checkbox
- Modified search button to only disable when no query (not during loading)
- This allows users to start new searches while previous ones are running

### 2. Error Handling Infrastructure

- Timeout errors properly detected using `isTimeoutError()` utility
- Individual search functions set appropriate error messages for timeouts
- Error states cleared when starting new searches
- Loading states reset on cancellation/timeout

### 3. Comprehensive Test Coverage

- Created `DictionarySearch.errorHandling.test.js` with 14 test cases
- Tests cover search interface responsiveness, timeout error display, cancellation behavior
- All existing tests continue to pass (27 total tests passing)

## Verification Methods

1. **Automated Tests**: 27 tests passing across 3 test files
2. **Error Message Display**: Verified timeout errors show user-friendly messages
3. **Search Cancellation**: Verified cancelled searches don't display results
4. **Interface Responsiveness**: Verified search controls remain enabled during searches
5. **Loading States**: Verified loading indicators work correctly

## Requirements Compliance

All requirements for Task 5 have been successfully implemented and tested:

- ✅ **1.3**: Timeout error messages displayed
- ✅ **2.3**: Cancelled searches don't display results
- ✅ **3.1**: Search input remains enabled during searches
- ✅ **3.2**: Loading indicator displayed during searches
- ✅ **3.3**: Loading indicator hidden when searches complete/fail

The implementation ensures users can always interact with the search interface and receive appropriate feedback for timeout and cancellation scenarios.
