# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical search hanging issues in the dictionary application where searches can become unresponsive, leaving users unable to perform new searches or cancel ongoing ones. The solution focuses on implementing basic timeout and cancellation mechanisms to ensure searches always complete or fail gracefully.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want searches to automatically timeout after a reasonable period, so that I'm never stuck waiting indefinitely for results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a search takes longer than 10 seconds THEN the system SHALL automatically cancel the search and show a timeout message
2. WHEN a search times out THEN the user SHALL be able to immediately start a new search
3. WHEN a search times out THEN the system SHALL display "Search timed out. Please try again." message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to cancel an ongoing search by starting a new one, so that I can quickly search for different terms without waiting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start a new search while another search is in progress THEN the system SHALL cancel the previous search
2. WHEN a search is cancelled due to a new search THEN the system SHALL immediately begin the new search
3. WHEN searches are cancelled THEN no results from cancelled searches SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the search interface to remain responsive during searches, so that I can interact with the application even while searches are running.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a search is in progress THEN the search input SHALL remain enabled for new searches
2. WHEN a search is in progress THEN the loading indicator SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN a search completes or fails THEN the loading indicator SHALL be hidden
