# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The dictionary search functionality is experiencing hanging issues that prevent users from completing searches effectively. The search process involves multiple parallel database queries and community definition lookups that can cause timeouts, infinite loading states, and poor user experience. This feature aims to optimize search performance by implementing timeouts, better error handling, caching strategies, and search result streaming to ensure reliable and fast search responses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user searching the dictionary, I want searches to complete within a reasonable time frame, so that I don't experience hanging or infinite loading states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a search THEN the search SHALL complete or timeout within 10 seconds maximum
2. WHEN a search times out THEN the system SHALL display partial results if any are available
3. WHEN a search times out THEN the system SHALL show a clear timeout message with retry options
4. WHEN multiple dictionary sources are being searched THEN each source SHALL have independent timeout handling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see search results as they become available, so that I don't have to wait for all sources to complete before seeing any results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a search is initiated THEN results SHALL be displayed progressively as each dictionary source responds
2. WHEN one dictionary source fails THEN other sources SHALL continue to load and display results
3. WHEN community definitions are being fetched THEN they SHALL not block the display of main dictionary results
4. WHEN a dictionary source is slow THEN users SHALL see loading indicators for that specific source only

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want search results to be cached appropriately, so that repeated searches are fast and don't cause unnecessary server load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a search is performed THEN results SHALL be cached for 5 minutes
2. WHEN the same search is performed within the cache period THEN cached results SHALL be returned immediately
3. WHEN community definitions are fetched THEN they SHALL be cached separately with appropriate invalidation
4. WHEN cache storage fails THEN the search SHALL continue without caching rather than failing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when searches encounter problems, so that I understand what happened and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a search fails completely THEN the system SHALL display a specific error message explaining the issue
2. WHEN individual dictionary sources fail THEN the system SHALL show which sources failed with retry options
3. WHEN network connectivity is poor THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate messaging and fallback options
4. WHEN community definitions fail to load THEN main dictionary results SHALL still be displayed with a notice about community content

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the search interface to remain responsive during searches, so that I can cancel, modify, or start new searches without the interface freezing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a search is in progress THEN the user SHALL be able to cancel the current search
2. WHEN a user types a new search term THEN the previous search SHALL be cancelled automatically
3. WHEN search results are loading THEN the search input SHALL remain functional for new searches
4. WHEN the interface is loading THEN users SHALL be able to navigate away from the search page without issues
