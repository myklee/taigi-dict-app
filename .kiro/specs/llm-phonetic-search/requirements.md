# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable intelligent phonetic search for Taiwanese words using romanization without requiring users to know correct accent marks, tone markers, or diacritics. Users can search using approximate phonetic spellings, and the LLM will interpret their input to find matching Taiwanese words in the dictionary. The system will use free, modern LLM models such as Google Gemini, Gemma, or Grok to provide accurate phonetic matching and suggestions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Taiwanese language learner, I want to search for words using approximate phonetic spelling without tone marks, so that I can find words even when I don't know the exact romanization or diacritics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters phonetic text without tone marks THEN the system SHALL use LLM processing to interpret the input and suggest matching Taiwanese words
2. WHEN the LLM identifies potential matches THEN the system SHALL return ranked results based on phonetic similarity and confidence scores
3. WHEN multiple interpretations are possible THEN the system SHALL show alternative suggestions with explanations
4. WHEN no exact matches are found THEN the system SHALL provide phonetically similar words as suggestions
5. IF the input is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions or show multiple possible interpretations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with limited Taiwanese knowledge, I want the system to understand common mispronunciations and alternative romanization systems, so that I can find words even with imperfect input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users input common English approximations of Taiwanese sounds THEN the system SHALL recognize and convert them to proper Tâi-lô romanization
2. WHEN users mix different romanization systems (POJ, TLPA, etc.) THEN the system SHALL interpret and normalize the input appropriately
3. WHEN users make typical pronunciation errors THEN the system SHALL account for these patterns and suggest corrections
4. WHEN users input partial or incomplete romanization THEN the system SHALL provide completion suggestions
5. IF users input sounds that don't exist in Taiwanese THEN the system SHALL suggest the closest Taiwanese phonetic equivalents

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast and reliable LLM-powered search results, so that I can get immediate feedback without long waiting times or service interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing LLM-powered searches THEN the system SHALL return results within 3 seconds under normal conditions
2. WHEN the LLM service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to traditional fuzzy search methods
3. WHEN processing complex queries THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators and progress feedback
4. WHEN rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL queue requests and notify users of expected wait times
5. IF LLM processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative search suggestions using existing search functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want to use free, modern LLM models efficiently, so that we can provide intelligent search without incurring significant costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating LLM services THEN the system SHALL prioritize free tier offerings from providers like Google Gemini, Gemma, or Grok
2. WHEN making LLM API calls THEN the system SHALL implement proper rate limiting and request optimization
3. WHEN processing user queries THEN the system SHALL cache LLM responses to reduce redundant API calls
4. WHEN LLM usage approaches limits THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent request batching and prioritization
5. IF multiple free models are available THEN the system SHALL implement fallback chains for reliability

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand how the LLM interpreted my phonetic input, so that I can learn proper romanization and improve my future searches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LLM processing returns results THEN the system SHALL show the interpreted romanization alongside the original input
2. WHEN phonetic corrections are made THEN the system SHALL highlight the differences and explain the changes
3. WHEN showing search results THEN the system SHALL display confidence scores and reasoning for matches
4. WHEN alternative interpretations exist THEN the system SHALL show them as expandable options with explanations
5. IF the LLM suggests learning resources THEN the system SHALL integrate these suggestions into the results display

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want LLM-powered phonetic search to work efficiently on my device, so that I can use intelligent search features while on the go.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the system SHALL optimize LLM requests for mobile network conditions
2. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL cache recent LLM interpretations for basic phonetic matching
3. WHEN on slow connections THEN the system SHALL provide progressive results and allow cancellation of long-running requests
4. WHEN using voice input THEN the system SHALL integrate speech-to-text with LLM phonetic interpretation
5. IF mobile data is limited THEN the system SHALL provide options to disable LLM features and use basic search

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user concerned about privacy, I want my search queries to be handled securely when using LLM services, so that my learning activities remain private.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending queries to LLM services THEN the system SHALL not include personally identifiable information
2. WHEN processing search history THEN the system SHALL anonymize data before LLM analysis
3. WHEN storing LLM responses THEN the system SHALL implement proper data retention policies
4. WHEN users opt out of LLM features THEN the system SHALL respect their privacy preferences completely
5. IF data sharing is required THEN the system SHALL provide clear disclosure and obtain explicit consent

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an advanced user, I want to fine-tune LLM search behavior and provide feedback, so that the system can improve its phonetic interpretation over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN LLM results are inaccurate THEN the system SHALL provide feedback mechanisms to report and correct errors
2. WHEN users have preferences for romanization systems THEN the system SHALL remember and apply these preferences in LLM processing
3. WHEN search patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL learn from user behavior to improve future interpretations
4. WHEN users provide corrections THEN the system SHALL use this feedback to enhance local caching and suggestions
5. IF users want to contribute training data THEN the system SHALL provide secure mechanisms for community-driven improvements
