# Empty State Debug Requirements

## Introduction

The user reports that they don't see the "no results found" message when searching for terms that should return no results. While the code appears to have the empty state implementation, we need to debug why it's not displaying correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Debug Empty State Visibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to debug why the empty state is not showing, so that I can identify and fix the issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I search for a non-existent term THEN the system SHALL log the current state values for debugging
2. WHEN the search completes with no results THEN the system SHALL verify that `searchExecuted` is true
3. WHEN the search completes with no results THEN the system SHALL verify that `totalResultsCount` equals 0
4. WHEN the search completes with no results THEN the system SHALL verify that all store result arrays are empty
5. WHEN the empty state condition is met THEN the system SHALL display the "No results found" message

### Requirement 2: Verify Search Flow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the search execution flow, so that I can ensure all steps are working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a search is initiated THEN the system SHALL set `loading` to true
2. WHEN a search is initiated THEN the system SHALL set `searchExecuted` to true
3. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL update all relevant store arrays
4. WHEN search completes THEN the system SHALL set `loading` to false
5. WHEN search completes with no results THEN the system SHALL display the empty state

### Requirement 3: Console Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed console logging during search, so that I can identify where the issue occurs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a search starts THEN the system SHALL log the search query and parameters
2. WHEN each dictionary search completes THEN the system SHALL log the result count
3. WHEN totalResultsCount is calculated THEN the system SHALL log the individual counts and total
4. WHEN the empty state condition is evaluated THEN the system SHALL log the condition result
5. WHEN the component renders THEN the system SHALL log which template section is being rendered
