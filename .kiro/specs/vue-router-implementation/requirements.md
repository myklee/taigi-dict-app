# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will replace the current manual routing system in the Taigi dictionary app with Vue Router 4, providing a more robust, scalable, and user-friendly navigation experience. The implementation will maintain all existing functionality while adding proper URL management, route parameters, navigation guards, and improved browser history handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper URL-based navigation so that I can bookmark specific pages and use browser back/forward buttons reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to any page THEN the URL SHALL reflect the current page location
2. WHEN a user bookmarks a URL THEN returning to that bookmark SHALL display the correct page
3. WHEN a user uses browser back/forward buttons THEN the application SHALL navigate correctly between previously visited pages
4. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the application SHALL maintain the current route and display the correct content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access specific dictionary entries via direct URLs so that I can share links to specific words or search results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user searches for a word THEN the URL SHALL include the search query as a parameter
2. WHEN a user views a specific word definition THEN the URL SHALL include the word identifier
3. WHEN a user shares a word URL with others THEN recipients SHALL see the same word definition
4. WHEN a user performs a search THEN the search state SHALL be preserved in the URL for sharing and bookmarking

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want protected routes for my profile and admin areas so that unauthorized users cannot access restricted content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access the profile page THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login/home page
2. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access admin routes THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the home page
3. WHEN a non-admin user tries to access admin routes THEN the system SHALL redirect them to their profile or home page
4. WHEN an authenticated user accesses protected routes THEN they SHALL see the appropriate content without redirection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and maintainable routing structure so that adding new pages and features is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new page THEN it SHALL require only adding a route configuration without modifying App.vue
2. WHEN the application starts THEN all routes SHALL be properly configured and accessible
3. WHEN route parameters are used THEN they SHALL be properly typed and validated
4. WHEN nested routes are needed THEN the router SHALL support hierarchical routing structure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth navigation between pages so that the app feels responsive and modern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between pages THEN transitions SHALL be smooth without page reloads
2. WHEN clicking navigation links THEN the active state SHALL be properly highlighted
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN loading states SHALL be handled appropriately
4. WHEN navigation fails THEN appropriate error handling SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want the routing to work seamlessly with Capacitor so that the app functions properly on iOS and Android.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app runs on mobile devices THEN all routing functionality SHALL work correctly
2. WHEN using Capacitor build THEN the router SHALL use appropriate history mode for mobile
3. WHEN deep linking is used on mobile THEN the app SHALL navigate to the correct route
4. WHEN the app is built for web and mobile THEN routing SHALL work consistently across platforms

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the existing navigation functionality to be preserved so that my current workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the router is implemented THEN all existing pages SHALL remain accessible
2. WHEN using the header navigation THEN all current navigation options SHALL continue to work
3. WHEN accessing admin features THEN all current admin functionality SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN using authentication features THEN login/logout behavior SHALL remain unchanged
